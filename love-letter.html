                I Have a Good Friend !

            <p>
                I have a good friend. She's beautiful and incredibly kind to me. She offers me more emotional value than anyone else. No matter where I go or what I do, she's always enthusiastic, never stingy with her support and affection. I love spending time with her.
            </p>
            <p>
                She's like a rainbow with all its colors, carrying the warm, comforting scent of freshly baked bread from a bakery. Her hugs are warmer than a hot water bottle, her heart softer than a feather pillow. She has this incredible ability to pull me out of the darkest places, and she’s genuinely sincere, with all her heart and soul.
            </p>

            <p>
                I hope she doesn't waste her tears on people who don't deserve to see that beautiful face of hers.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope she finds wealth, love, and that good luck follows her always!
            </p>
